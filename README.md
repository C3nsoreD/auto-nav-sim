# Navigation simulator based on Ml models
Navigation simulator using Reinforcement & Machine learning algorithms. Based on the work of "Autonomous UAV Navigation Using Reinforcement Learning" and "Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning" 

## Image processing for UAV navigation

Testing methods that would be useful for the autonomous flight and naviagtion for UAVs. 
Using Computer vision algorithms and OpenCv.
