# Navigation simulator with turtle and RL
Navigation simulator using RL algorithms. based on the work of "Autonomous UAV Navigation Using Reinforcement Learning" and "Human-level control through deep reinforcement
learning" 

## Image processing for UAV navigation

Testing methods that would be useful for the autonomous flight and naviagtion of UAV. 
Using Computer vision algorithms and OpenCv.
